SMAX is a purely JAX SMAC-like environment that focuses on decentralized unit micromanagement across a range of scenarios. Each scenario features fixed teams where agents must learn to coordinate their actions to defeat enemy units. The environment simulates real-time strategy combat scenarios with multiple units that can move, attack, and use special abilities. Agents observe the state of their units and enemies, and must make tactical decisions to maximize their team's performance.

**Scenario: 10 marines vs 11 marines**
